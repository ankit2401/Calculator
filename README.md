# Calculator
Directions

This exercise will help you understand how to use JavaScript functions and algorithms.

Step 1: Set up your project.
Create an Calculator.html file.
Create a Calculator.js file and link it to your Calculator.html file.

Step 3: Write the JavaScript

This is the main part of the project. You will have to react to click events on each calculator button and update the display. Start small by making the numbers work, then move on to the operators, decimal button, and equals button.

When a user presses the equals button, evaluate the math expression they have created and put the result in the display. Further buttons pressed add operators and numbers after that result.

You do not have to stop users from entering bad input. For instance, if a user enters 2.1.0 -+ 7, you can let them enter that and do not have to show any special output when they try to evaluate it using the equals button. It is fine if you do prevent them from entering bad input, though.

You do not have to allow for chaining long calculations (like 2 + 4 * 7 - 2), but you can.

Hint: One way of evaluating mathematical expressions is eval. Another way is by using the math.js library.
